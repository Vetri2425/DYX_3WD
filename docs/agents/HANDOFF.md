## 2026-09-05 — Claude — repository skeleton (Milestone 1)

**Changed**
- Created `DYX_3WD` workspace, mirroring the `DYX_4WD` build flow.
- `docs/architecture/DYX_3WD_Production_Stack_Architecture_V1.md` — the specification.
- `docs/Firmware/F-tasks.md` — upstream issue audit + 39-commit carry-over audit.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — 6 jobs (see below).
- 12 ROS package skeletons, backend, 5 systemd units, installer skeleton, `CLAUDE.md`.

**Deliberate divergences from DYX_4WD** — do not "fix" these to match:
1. **Five services, not four.** `dyx3-rtk` is a sibling of the backend, not a child. In
   `PX4_DXP` the NTRIP client was a child process of `rover-server`, so any `server/**` deploy
   silently dropped the rover to FLOAT with no warning in the app.
2. **`dyx3_rpp_legacy` exists** — a quarantined `ament_python` package. 4WD has no equivalent.
   CI job `legacy_quarantine` enforces the four quarantine terms.
3. **No `dyx3_trajectory` package.** The path engine stays Python in `backend/path_engine/`
   (spec 7.2). 4WD has a C++ `dyx_trajectory`.
4. **`dyx3_geometry` is native-testable** (`-DDYX3_NATIVE_TESTS=ON`), with its own CI job.
5. **`dyx3_motion_guard` / `dyx3_px4_link`** replace 4WD's `dyx_motion_control` /
   `dyx_px4_gateway` — named for responsibility, not message conversion.

**Ran**
- `python3 -c "yaml.safe_load(...)"` on `ci.yml` — parses, 6 jobs.

**Not run**
- `colcon build` — no ROS 2 on this Mac. CI on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` is authoritative.
- `pytest backend/tests` — deps not installed locally.
- **CI has never run on this repo.** Nothing here is verified green.

**DERIVED — NOT FROM V1 SPEC**
- Package module file lists (e.g. `dyx3_rpp`'s ten modules) are read off the architecture's
  decomposition table but the exact file split is a judgement call.
- systemd hardening stanzas are ported from `PX4_DXP`'s `px4-dxp.service`, including the
  `SCHED_FIFO 80` / `CPUAffinity=4` block on `dyx3-ros`. Those numbers came from a CubeOrange+
  Jetson tuning session and **must be re-derived** for the production hardware.
- `/opt/dyx3/current/bin/dyx3-*` ExecStart paths assume the filesystem layout in spec 12.

**Next agent should do first**
1. Push and get CI green. It has never run.
2. Milestone 2 — freeze `dyx3_interfaces`, starting with `MotionSetpoint`.
3. Classify all 174 parameters (120 RPP + 54 spray) as LIVE / IDLE_ONLY / RESTART.

**Open questions for the human**
- `F-tasks.md` Part E, questions 1–6 — in particular whether to reproduce upstream #27497
  (rover differential won't turn in Mission Mode on v1.17) before designing the F4 gate.
- Commit attribution: `CLAUDE.md` in the firmware repos says no Claude attribution; the current
  session config requires a `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Which wins?
